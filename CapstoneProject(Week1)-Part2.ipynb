    "It was discussed that in order to set up a successful Chinese restaurant, the following will be needed:\n",

    "1. Collect the various Toronto neighbourhoods (e.g. from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M)\n",
    "2. Gather the geospatial data from a previous lab (e.g. https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs_v1/Geospatial_Coordinates.csv)\n",

    "Ideally, a neighbourhood that has a growing (i.e. not negative) population growth, sufficient income (perhaps above $40,000 per annnum - actual amount will be determined later), and few Chinese restaurants with good ratings on Foursquare will be a good place to set up the business."
